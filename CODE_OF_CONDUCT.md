# Code of Conduct
## Introduction

We are committed to cultivating a respectful and productive environment for working and learning. Those interacting with this repository are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. This applies in all avenues associated with this project including but not limited to collaborator meetings and online communications. The primary contributors will be responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. All reports will be reviewed by such persons or instructors and be kept confidential.

As collaborators on this project, we pledge to respect all those contributing to knowledge and bettering our community through issue reports, pull requests, and other related activities. We are committed to respecting all, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

##  Expected Behavior

Everyone who interacts with this project is expected to uphold respect and show courtesy to others. Interactions should be professional, and foster a inclusive and positive environment. 

Our expectations for each other: 

- **Respect each other:** As mentioned above, we pledge to respect regardless of anyone’s evel of experience, gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality. This is an expectation for everyone!
- **Commitment to group and self-improvement:** We want to be generous and gentle in giving and receiving critiques. Everyone comes from different backgrounds, so supporting each other helps everyone!

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following represent an non-exhaustive list of unacceptable behaviors:

- Unwelcoming behaviour, whether it’s flat out harassment or microaggressions. 
- This goes under the above but to be more explicit, any kind of derogatory comments or insults will not be tolerated.

## A procedure for reporting and dealing with unacceptable behaviour
- **Talking it out with the person:** If the situation is comfortable enough to do this, try this out first and let them know if they've done something to make you uncomfortable. 
- **Tell another team member:** If you’re unsure if this should be brought to other people’s attention, make sure you discuss it with a team member.
- **Talk to an instructor:** If you feel something needs to be addressed to the instructor or TAs, bring it to their attention, reporting the situation to the best of your ability.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior 
Individuals called out on inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. Failure to do so will warrant a warning before more serious measures are taken to ensure a appropriate response for violating the Code of Conduct, such as: 
- removal from the project
- whatever else deemed appropriate by the instructor (e.g., lower grade)

## Incident Reporting Guidelines 

If someone is violating the Code of Conduct in any manner, we ask that it is reported to the project contributors, or the other project contributors if the violator is a contributor themselves. Contributors reserve the right to consult with other authorities, such as instructors or academic resource staff, in such a situations.
