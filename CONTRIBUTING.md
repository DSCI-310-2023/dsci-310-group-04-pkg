###### Welcome to group-04's dsci-310 package! 

# Here's how you can contribute to this package: 

If you notice a bug, or have a feature request, please open up an issue [here](https://github.com/annabelle-ep/dsci-310-group-04/issues).
If you'd like to contribute a feature or bug fix, you can fork our repo and submit a pull request.
All contributors must abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Make sure to include the following if your report is about: 
- **readability issues**: If any of our installation, coding comments (or if we're missing comments!), or steps are unclear, please submit an issue about what was unclear and where you found it. We will try our best to update it if needed, or provide an explanation if appropriate!
- **bugs**: If there are any bugs in the code, we encourage you to figure out how to fix them yourself and explain the post and issue. If you have trouble with fixing it, by all means share the error or situation, and describe the steps you took to get to that. Please make sure descriptions give the exact steps to make things reproducable and easy to follow. Explain why you did things as well so contributors can get a sense of your thought process.
