Description: This package attempts to build a k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classification model to predict song genres using various Spotify's audio features as predictors: danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo. The data set used is from rdatascience/tidytuesday data. It uses spotifyr to get audio track features from Spotify's Web API. It can be found specifically with this URL, but also in our repository data folder.
